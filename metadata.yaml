summary: Fleetwood was an African American who rose to rank of sergeant-major and
  received the Congressional Medal of Honor. He gives an account of the African American
  soldier from the Revolutionary War to the Civil War to show his suitability for
  military service, with concentration on the Civil War. He cites instances of valor
  and testimonials thereto, statistics on Black enlistments by state and on casualties,
  and lists African Americans who received the Congressional Medal of Honor.
